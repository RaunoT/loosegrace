# Loose Grace

Static HTML website for the band Loose Grace, using [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

## Quickstart

`npm i` - Install dependencies

`npm run dev` - Start development server and live-reloading for changes

`npm run build` - Build assets

To deploy, move files in `/dist` to `/docs` and push the changes. Don't forget to remove both folders first to avoid unused files (keep CNAME in `/docs` folder).
